Input can return virtual key code or linux equivalent, then we send that, and it gets sent back to OS which knows what to do with it,
but problem then is app doesn't know what the key is (unless it coverts depending on OS), and can't do Linux to Windows.

So first convert to my own code, then process by app (platform independent) and transmit, then convert to OS code.


How is VkKeyScan getting the shift state from a char? It's a different char when you press shift or ctrl!!
